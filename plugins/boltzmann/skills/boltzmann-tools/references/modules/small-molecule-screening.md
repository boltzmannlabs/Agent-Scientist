## 33. Butina Clustering
Cluster a SMILES library by whole-molecule or Murcko-scaffold fingerprints and
optionally configure sampling and dimensionality reduction.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **job_name** | `Butina_Clustering` |
| **backend task** | `butina` |
| **validation status** | **Verified working** |
| **accepted input** | uploaded `.csv` with a `SMILES` column |
| **observed terminal status** | `Success` |

### Inputs

All six fields are compulsory.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Exact values and meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Path` | platform path string | yes | Uploaded CSV containing `SMILES`. Capital `P` is required. |
| `model` | string enum | yes | `Butina` or `Murcko-Butina`. |
| `DimReduce` | string enum | yes | API schema values `PCA` or `TSNE`; the UI may display `tSNE`. Only `PCA` is live-proven in the current evidence. |
| `sampling_type` | string enum | yes | `Random` or `Min_max`. It is still sent when `sampling` is `no`. |
| `cutoff` | number | yes | Clustering cutoff. `0.4` is end-to-end verified; `-1` is newly submission-accepted as an automatic/default sentinel, but its terminal semantics are not yet verified. |
| `sampling` | string enum | yes | Exact lowercase string `yes` or `no`, not a boolean. |

The screenshot/test note spells one option `Min_Max`, while the authoritative
frontend validation schema uses `Min_max`. Until a live submission proves the
capital-`M` variant, use exact API value `Min_max`.

```python
uploaded_library_path = file_upload(local_smiles_csv)

job_name = "Butina_Clustering"
experiment_name = "Butina clustering"
experiment_data = {
    "Path": uploaded_library_path,
    "model": "Butina",
    "DimReduce": "PCA",
    "sampling_type": "Random",
    "cutoff": 0.4,
    "sampling": "no",
}
```

For a diverse library, `0.4` can produce many singleton clusters; use a
different cutoff only when scientifically justified. Do not silently replace a
user-specified cutoff with the newly accepted `-1` sentinel.

### Output instructions

The verified terminal result exposes a list-shaped
`OutputData.outputFilePath`; download each link and identify `butina.csv`.
The live artifact contained 7,543 rows with exact columns:

```text
ID,ClusterID,SMILES
```

This live artifact supersedes the older product-sheet claim
`SMILES,Labels`. `ClusterID` values are zero-based integers and need not be
contiguous in input order. Preserve `ID` and `SMILES` for joining results back
to the source library. Report molecule count, distinct cluster count, singleton
count, and largest-cluster size from the actual CSV.

### Evidence

- The all-experiments schema confirms the six compulsory fields and their
  enum values.
- An earlier canary reached terminal `Success`; `butina.csv` downloaded and
  parsed as 7,543 rows with `ID,ClusterID,SMILES`.
- The newest payload using `sampling="yes"`, `sampling_type="Random"`, and
  `cutoff=-1` returned HTTP 200. Only submission is proven for that variant.

## 34. K-Means Clustering

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **job_name** | `K_Means_Clustering` |

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| `Path` | string | yes | S3 path to CSV (upload first) — capital P |
| `Features` | string | yes | `"descriptors"` or `"fingerprints"` |
| `DimReduce` | string | yes | `"PCA"` or `"tSNE"` |
| `no_of_cluster` | int | yes | Number of clusters |

**Output CSV columns:** `ID, ClusterID, SMILES` (only 3 columns)

---

## 35. Similarity Screening

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **job_name** | `Similarity_Screening` |

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| `ref_smile` | string | yes | Reference SMILES |
| `lib_mols_path` | string | yes | S3 path to CSV (upload first) |
| `screen_threshold` | number | yes | Similarity threshold; use roughly 0.6+ for close analogues or 0.3–0.5 for scaffold hopping |

**Input CSV columns:** `SMILES`

**Output key:** `sim_screen_data_path` (NOT `outputFilePath`)

**Output CSV columns:** `Tanimoto_Similarity, Ref_Smile, SMILES` plus descriptors
and any pass-through library columns. Descriptor columns may be duplicated as
identical `_x`/`_y` pairs; read either copy.

---

## 36. Pharmacophore Screening

The receptor workflow was live-verified but cost 200 credits in the observed
run. Confirm that cost with the user before submitting.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **job_name** | `Pharmacophore_Screening` |

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| `hypothesis_path` | string | yes | S3 path to hypothesis file (from phcore_gen) |
| `library` | string | yes | S3 path to CSV (upload first) |
| `min_features` | int | yes | Minimum features to match |

**Input CSV columns:** `SMILES, NAMES`

The verified result uses `OutputData.outputFilePath` as a list. Rank hits by
`RMSD` ascending; use the numeric feature `count` because the observed
`features_matched` strings were placeholders.

---

## 37. Substructure Screening

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **job_name** | `Substructure_Screening` |

**Inputs:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Notes |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|
| `library_path` | string | yes | S3 path to CSV (upload first) |
| `substructures_path` | string | yes | S3 path to CSV (upload first) |
| `method` | string | yes | `"graph_matcher"` or `"rdkit"` |
| `task` | string | yes | `"toxic"` or `"substructure"` |
| `screening_type` | string | yes | `"in"` or `"out"` |

**Output CSV columns:** `Tanimoto_Similarity, Ref_Smile, SMILES, LABELS, Message`

---

## 38. Novelty Check
Compare an uploaded SMILES library against a selected reference collection by
exact identity or molecular similarity.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **job_name** | `Novelty` |
| **backend task** | `novelty` |
| **validation status** | **Verified working for ChEMBL identity; Enamine submission verified** |
| **accepted input** | uploaded `.csv` with a `SMILES` column |
| **observed terminal status** | `Success` for the verified ChEMBL run |

### Inputs

Send all four fields. Although the threshold affects similarity searches, the
frontend schema requires a numeric value for identity searches too.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Exact values and meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | platform path string | yes | Uploaded CSV containing a case-sensitive `SMILES` column. |
| `library` | string enum | yes | Exact value `ChEMBL`, `SureChEMBL`, or `Enamine`. |
| `STRUCTURE_SEARCH` | string enum | yes | Exact API value `Identical` or `Similarity`. |
| `threshold` | number | yes | Similarity cutoff for `Similarity`; still send a numeric value for `Identical`, conventionally `0`. |

The UI label **Identity** maps to API value `Identical`. Never submit
`"STRUCTURE_SEARCH": "Identity"`. The screenshot confirms all three library
choices and both UI search choices; the all-experiments schema confirms their
payload values. An older BoltChem note lists only ChEMBL and SureChEMBL, but
the newer schema plus an HTTP-200 Enamine submission supersede that stale list.

```python
uploaded_library_path = file_upload(local_smiles_csv)

job_name = "Novelty"
experiment_name = "Novelty identity screen against Enamine"
experiment_data = {
    "path": uploaded_library_path,
    "library": "Enamine",
    "STRUCTURE_SEARCH": "Identical",
    "threshold": 0.35,
}
```

For `Similarity`, require a user-provided or scientifically justified threshold
between 0 and 1. Do not silently reuse `0.35` merely because it was accepted in
the Enamine identity submission; identity mode does not establish similarity
threshold behavior.

### Output instructions

The verified ChEMBL identity result uses the tool-specific envelope:

```python
result["OutputData"]["similarity_summary"]["path"]
result["OutputData"]["similarity_summary"]["download_link"]
```

Do not assume `outputFilePath`. The downloaded
`identical_output_data.csv` preserved all 40 input rows and contained:

```text
SMILES,ACTIVITY,details
```

`ACTIVITY` was an input-column pass-through, not a novelty score. Other input
columns may similarly pass through. `details` is a Python-literal list rather
than JSON; parse it safely with `ast.literal_eval`, never `eval`. Each observed
hit dictionary contained `chembl_id`, `SMILES`, and `Score`. Report hit count,
top reference identifier, and score per molecule. The verified run contained
no novel/no-hit molecule, so treat empty-`details` interpretation as requiring
sanity checking rather than claiming that branch is proven.

The Enamine identity payload is submission-verified only because result lookup
was unavailable during this update. Do not describe its terminal output as
verified until the document reaches a terminal state and its artifact is
inspected.

### Evidence

- The all-experiments schema confirms `ChEMBL`, `SureChEMBL`, and `Enamine`,
  and maps search payload values to `Identical` and `Similarity`.
- The supplied screenshot independently confirms the three screen choices and
  the UI labels `Identity` and `Similarity`.
- An earlier ChEMBL/`Identical` canary completed end to end; its 40-row artifact
  was downloaded and inspected.
- The newest Enamine/`Identical` payload returned HTTP 200. Current network
  restrictions prevented a fresh result fetch, so that new variant remains
  submission-verified rather than terminal-verified.

## 60. QSPR Screening
Screen an uploaded molecule library against selected property or ADMET filters.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **job_name** | `QSPR_Screening` |
| **Mongo diagnostics collection** | `reward-based-screening` (verified sample record); pair with the returned experiment ID. |
| **backend task** | `screening` |
| **validation status** | **Verified working** |
| **accepted input** | uploaded `.csv` with a `SMILES` column |
| **observed terminal status** | `Success` |

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Required | Validation and meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | platform path string | yes | Uploaded CSV containing a case-sensitive `SMILES` column. Use lowercase `path`. |
| `filters` | list of objects | yes for fixed-filter screening | Each item uses the exact keys `value` and `type`. Do not use `prop_name`, `label`, or a display label as the payload object. |
| `custom_models` | list of objects | no | May be omitted or sent as `[]`; both forms have produced HTTP 200. A selected custom model requires `id`, `min_threshold`, and `max_threshold` according to the validation schema, but that non-empty branch is not live-verified here. |

The latest accepted submission omitted `custom_models`, correcting an older
contract that called the field universally required. Include `custom_models:
[]` when composing a stable explicit payload, but do not reject a payload only
because the empty field is omitted.

The only exact fixed-filter objects currently proven from payload sources are:

```python
{"value": "BBB", "type": "Permeable"}
{"value": "BBB", "type": "Impermeable"}
{"value": "Bioavailability", "type": "Bioavailable"}
```

The UI exposes many more labels, including CYP, clearance, half-life,
lipophilicity, permeability, protein-binding, solubility, toxicity, Tox21,
biodegradability, endocrine, eye-corrosion, and genotoxicity endpoints. A label
alone does not prove its exact `value`/`type` pair. Preserve the pair emitted by
the UI or another validated source; never derive payload capitalization or
spelling from the visible label. Do not request mutually contradictory states
for the same property unless the user explicitly wants both result classes.

```python
uploaded_library_path = file_upload(local_smiles_csv)

job_name = "QSPR_Screening"
experiment_name = "QSPR screening - BBB and bioavailability"
experiment_data = {
    "path": uploaded_library_path,
    "filters": [
        {"value": "BBB", "type": "Permeable"},
        {"value": "Bioavailability", "type": "Bioavailable"},
    ],
    "custom_models": [],
}
```

Before uploading, parse the CSV, require a non-empty `SMILES` column, and
validate every non-empty SMILES value. Do not place raw CSV content or a local
filesystem path in `path`.

### Output instructions

The verified terminal result uses:

```python
result["OutputData"]["filtered_data"]["path"]
result["OutputData"]["filtered_data"]["download_link"]
```

The verified `filtered_data.csv` preserved 40 input rows and contained:

```text
SMILES,ACTIVITY,Mol_wt,LogP,numHacceptors,numHdonors,TPSA,QED,SA,LogS,
BBB,Bioavailability
```

Input columns can pass through, descriptors are appended, and each selected
filter adds a verdict column named for its `value`. In the verified sample all
40 molecules passed, so that run does not prove whether failing molecules are
dropped or retained. Report actual input/output row counts and verdict counts
from the artifact rather than assuming either behavior.

### Evidence

- The all-experiments schema confirms the CSV path, `{value, type}` filter
  objects, and `{id, min_threshold, max_threshold}` custom-model shape.
- An earlier end-to-end canary reached terminal `Success`; its artifact was
  downloaded and parsed as the 40-row CSV described above.
- The newest test payload used two `{value, type}` filters, omitted
  `custom_models`, and returned HTTP 200, proving that omission is accepted.
- API-style filter keys such as `prop_name` and `label` previously caused HTTP
  400; use the UI-style keys exactly.
