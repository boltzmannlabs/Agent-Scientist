"""The launch home is pinned once the process serves several profiles (#119242).

``sci_constants.pin_process_sci_home`` (salvaged from #119129) gives the four routed-profile
decisions one stable launch-home identity; ``set_multiplex_active(True)`` pins it automatically for
a multiplexing gateway/dashboard, since neither calls the pin itself. Two contracts around that:

* ``get_process_sci_home()`` / ``get_sci_home()`` keep following ``SCI_HOME`` while the
  pin holds — a host's env mirror exists so override-less readers see the served profile, and an
  env-only home switch (``profiles._cleanup_gateway_service``) must not resolve to the launch home.
* Deactivation releases only the pin activation itself created: an embedding host's explicit pin
  survives the transient toggles in ``gateway_migrate._multiplex_read_mode`` and cron workers.
