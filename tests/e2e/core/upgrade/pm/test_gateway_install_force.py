"""The PM runtime lock is where PM commands look for it (PM lifecycle, class 6; #124075).

The field report: after ``sci gateway install --force`` the gateway crash-looped with "no
dependency environment is committed" and ``sci pm repair`` / ``pm doctor`` / ``pm status`` all
died on ``FileNotFoundError: <install>/environments/<env>/workspace/pm/uv.lock``.

``--force`` was incidental: every generation's ``workspace/`` copy was materialised without
``pm/uv.lock`` (the copy dropped every file named ``uv.lock``), so ANY ``sci pm`` command run
by the selected generation's own ``sci`` (the one on PATH for every child a Sci process
spawns, and the one a unit pointing at the managed environment runs) died before it started.
After a dependency-changing ``sci update``:

* ``sci gateway install --force`` (service manager is a failing shim: the unit write is what
  is exercised) leaves the install bootable: ``sci pm status`` / ``pm doctor`` run and
  ``sci gateway run`` reaches running;
* ``sci pm status`` / ``pm doctor`` also run from the managed environment's ``sci``.
