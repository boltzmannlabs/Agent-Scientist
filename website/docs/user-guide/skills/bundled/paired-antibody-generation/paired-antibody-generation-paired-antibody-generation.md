# Paired antibody generation Skill

Use an actual paired generative model for de novo requests; database retrieval and uniform amino-acid randomization are not substitutes. Specify VH/VL versus full-length chains and distinguish computational checks from functional validation.

## When to Use

Use for requests matching the workflow below; do not extend the scientific scope without clarification.

## Prerequisites

Inspect current tools with `tool_search` where available and installed skills with `skills_list`. Service connections, authorization, datasets, and scientific software are not included merely by installing these instructions. Verify the prerequisites in the procedure; obtain approval before downloads, installation, or execution.

## How to Run

Use `read_file` for supplied documents and `search_files` for local discovery. Use configured scientific tools when suitable; any local execution uses `terminal` in an approved environment, never an ad hoc modification of the Agent Scientist runtime. Keep credentials and private samples out of reusable instructions.

## Quick Reference

Confirm the requested input, output, available tools, and prerequisites before following the workflow. These instructions are not proof of scientific validity or an installed service.

## Procedure

### Workflow specification and provider selection

- Inspect available scientific tools before choosing execution. Prefer authorized Boltzmann workflows with matching installed contracts; use the local unconditional-generation procedure below only when no suitable tool exists or the user explicitly requests local execution. Never switch providers silently after authentication failure.
- For a workflow-only request, create a concrete SOP and request templates without submitting jobs. Mark missing required values and experiment names unresolved, distinguish proposed settings from confirmed inputs, and validate request field names and dependency order.
- Build target-aware handoffs as antigen/framework structures -> structural design -> paired sequence design when needed -> paired QC -> developability/CDR predictions -> antigen/VH/VL complex prediction -> optional interface scoring -> shortlist. Require explicit source pairing and actual output inspection at every boundary; separate submission acceptance from terminal and scientific validation.
- Use complete prediction bundles with matching confidence/PAE companions for interface scoring. Keep antigen-to-antibody scores separate from VH-to-VL scores because the internal antibody interface does not establish target binding.
- Record partial output counts without inventing pairings or launching automatic top-up jobs. Preserve framework numbering when mapping CDR selections to structure-conditioned sequence-design inputs.

### Local unconditional-generation workflow

1. Inspect primary source https://github.com/OliverT1/p-IgGen and model card ollieturnbull/p-IgGen. Read model.py and utils.py rather than guessing APIs. Check hardware and free GPU memory without disturbing other workloads.
2. Use an isolated Python 3.11 environment outside the user's project. A tested combination is torch==2.8.0, transformers==4.56.2, antpack==0.3.8.6.2 and p-IgGen source package. Increase UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT for wheel download timeouts; do not change global environments.
3. Resolve and record model and source commit hashes. Download a pinned Hugging Face snapshot, then construct piggen.model.pIgGen(model_name=local_snapshot, device='cuda'). Seed transformers.set_seed. Generate small batches with model.generate(num_return_sequences=5, temp=1.0, top_p=0.95, discard_bottom_n_percent=None) under torch.inference_mode(). No antigen prompt is needed for unconditional generation.
4. Store formatted raw samples incrementally. The model emits concatenated VH+VL; do not split by assumed length. Use antpack.PairedChainAnnotator(scheme='imgt').analyze_seq(sequence), requiring H and K/L calls with empty errors. trim_alignment(sequence, result) returns sequence, numbering, start, exclusive end. Require complete nonoverlapping domains covering the whole generated sequence, retaining original pairings. Endpoint checks used in the tested workflow were H 1/128 and L 1/127. Document acceptance criteria.
5. Keep the first requested number of unique accepted pairs, with a bounded retry budget and rejection log. Export paired CSV and separate VH/VL FASTA records. Save seed, sampling settings, versions, hashes, generation code, and validation report. Re-read exports to verify counts, unique pairs, amino-acid alphabet, cross-format equivalence, and annotation calls.
6. Report actual outputs, tools, and absolute paths. Never call outputs experimentally validated binders. Domain annotation is not structure prediction, functional validation, or a guarantee of novelty relative to training data.

### Target-aware pipelines and reporting

- When alternatives are authorized, discover tools by the required scientific capability, then validate the selected tool's exact schema. A retrieval tool or documentation-information tool is not a generator or simulator.
- Keep unconditional paired generation distinct from antigen-conditioned design; antibody architecture checks and generic binding scores do not establish binding to a named antigen.
- Apply solubility and absolute melting-temperature thresholds only when the returned model's scale, units, and applicability are verified. Mutation ddG and sequence instability indices are not melting temperatures in degrees Celsius.
- For multi-stage requests, report each stage as actual input -> operation and actual tool -> returned artifact -> exact transformation for the next stage. Preserve IDs and VH/VL pairing; stop dependent stages on an error or unmet required gate instead of inventing scores or forcing a top-N shortlist.
- Consolidate necessary target-state, epitope, framework, run-size, and compute-budget questions into one clarification round before submissions. Distinguish a pilot trajectory from converged or experimental validation.

## Pitfalls

- The upstream separated-output CLI has suspicious iteration over a tuple of chain lists; use Python generation API and explicitly paired annotation/export instead.
- The upstream batch_size argument does not implement chunked generation; manually loop over small num_return_sequences batches to bound memory.
- Upstream README direction wording is inconsistent. Verify implementation: forward prompt is '1', forward output is VH+VL, terminating at '2'.
- Annotation scores are not folding or binding probabilities.

## Verification

Inspect actual outputs, provenance, counts, units, and limitations. Report missing dependencies or partial results honestly. A successful command or security review does not establish scientific correctness.
